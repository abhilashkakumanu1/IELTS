## Topic 1: Work and careers

### Question

Some employers offer their employees subsidised membership of gyms and sports clubs, believing that this will make their staff healthier and thus more effective at work. Other employers see no benefit in doing so.

Consider the arguments from both aspects of this possible debate, and reach a conclusion.

### Modal Ans

Employers are always seeking ways to enhance their employees’ **productivity**, and **subsidising** healthy pursuits may be one way of achieving this. There are arguments on both sides, however, which we will discuss here.

On the one hand, it might be said that if workers are fitter and less stressed, their working time will be more efficient, leading to higher levels of **output** and service. Furthermore, the **work/life balance** of the staff will hopefully be improved, because their leisure time will be more fulfilling. This may even be more **motivating** than **pay increments**, **perks**, or **financial rewards** such as **bonuses** or **incentives** which may be hard to attain. Finally, feeling healthier may lead to better **job satisfaction** which is in itself a motivating factor.

Conversely, the problem with such leisure-based subsidies is that their efficacy is virtuallyimpossible to quantify. For example, with **target-related** payments, employers can at least see whether the objectives are reached or not. It might also be said that, if this budget was spent on (for instance) **on the job training** or **day release programmes**, the employees would achieve better **career progression** and have better **job prospects**. These matters are all easier to **measure**, especially in **performance reviews** and **appraisals**, and may even help to reduce the risk of **redundancy** if the company **restructures**, **downsizes** or **outsources** its **workforce**.

Overall, it seems that, while health-related subsidies are **superficially** attractive, the lack of **measurability** is a substantial drawback. Spending funds on **ongoing training** would appear to be a better use of company or **Human Resources** budgets.

## Topic 2: Education and schooling

### Question

‘The Internet will never replace traditional course books in schools.’
How far do you agree with this prediction?

### Modal Ans

There is a huge range of resources available to the modern teacher, and the right selection is crucial in delivering effective lessons. I agree that there will always be a place for course books in the school **curriculum**, despite the many benefits of the Internet.

Firstly, course books (whether conventional or digital) have been developed by **pedagogical** experts and designed to be incorporated into a subject **syllabus**, leading to testing procedures such as **formal examinations** or **continuous assessment**. This means that they are proven to improve students’ **academic achievement**, enhancing their potential for progression to further or higher education. Furthermore, the use of modern course books allows pupils to coordinate their studies as part of **group work**, hopefully making their lessons less **teacher-led** and more about **autonomous learning**. This in itself teaches **study skills** such as independent research and **synthesising sources**, rather than old-fashioned **rote-learning**. This is where the Internet, in fact, can play a useful part: to **supplement** and add to knowledge which the students are **assimilating** via their course books.

However, it is the role of teachers and school management generally to ensure that use of the Internet remains a **guided learning** process, and not an exercise in **data-gathering** from Internet sources which may be unreliable or even misleading.
It is true that the Internet can be invaluable for adults (for example in **distance learning** or **self-study** modules) who are able to **discriminate between sources** and **sift information** to **marshal their facts**. However, this is a mature skill and we should not assume that school age pupils are ready to do this.

Overall, it appears that course books, with their quality and depth of material, are set to remain an **integral part of the syllabus**. The internet can be judged a useful supplement to this, if used carefully and **under supervision**.

2. **pedagogical** - experts in education and teaching

13. **to synthesise sources** - to use a variety of sources and combine them in one project
14. rote learning - learning by repetition and memorising items

18. data-gathering
19. distance learning
20. self-study - studying using a course without a teacher’s involvement
21. **to discriminate between sources** - to decide whether one source is better or more reliable than another source
22. **to marshal facts** - to organise facts in support of an idea
23. an integral part of the syllabus

## Topic 3: Children and families

### Question

Some people believe that children should spend all of their free time with their families. Others believe that this is unnecessary or even negative. Discuss the possible arguments on both sides, and say which side you personally support.

### Modal Ans

Nobody can deny that parental influence is important for children, at least in cases where children live with their parents, **foster parents** or **guardians**. However, it is by no means clear that children should spend time exclusively in the family, as we will see.

On the one hand, it may appear advisable for parents to act as **role models** and to establish **ground rules** for behaviour by spending as much time as possible with their children. This allows the youngsters to absorb **conventions** and **codes of conduct** which they can then follow themselves, hopefully leading to an absence of problems such as **bullying**, **truancy** and **delinquency** later on. Furthermore, being with the family should reduce the risk of children falling victim to crimes such **abduction**, or coming under the influence of negative **peer pressure**.

On the other hand, we have to ask whether this is a practical proposition. In a society where many families are **dual-income**, or where one parent’s role as **breadwinner** means he/she is away from the family for long periods, it is inevitable that children cannot spend all of their time with the family. **Child-minding** and **after-school childcare** are often used in these cases, and if managed properly, these can be perfectly **viable** alternatives. Equally, it seems that children can in some cases learn a considerable amount from their **peers** in addition to adults, and allowing them to play without direct supervision may be a benefit.

To conclude, it appears that, while family time is essential for **bonding** and absorbing **patterns of behaviour**, there are definite advantages when children are outside the family too. This is provided that they are in a safe, **well-behaved** environment with peers who are themselves reasonably **well brought-up**.

### Vocabulary

1. **foster parents** - temporary commitment (unlike adoption)
2. guardians
3. role models
4. ground rules - basic rules governing the way people can behave in a situation
5. conventions - traditions

9. **delinquency** - minor crime (often by young people)
10. abduction
11. peer pressure
12. dual-income
13. breadwinner
14. child-minding - caring informally (not in schools) for children when parents are busy or working
15. after-school childcare - caring for children in a school setting
16. viable - practical
17. peers - people in the same group or level as yourself
18. bonding
19. patterns of behaviour - ways of acting an doing things
20. well brought-up (to bring up children = to raise and educate them in your own moral, behavioural or religious conventions)
