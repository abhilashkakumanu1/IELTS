## Topic 1: Work and careers

### Question - (OPINION > DISCUSSION)

Some employers offer their employees subsidised membership of gyms and sports clubs, believing that this will make their staff healthier and thus more effective at work. Other employers see no benefit in doing so.

Consider the arguments from both aspects of this possible debate, and reach a conclusion.

### Model Ans

Employers are always seeking ways to enhance their employees’ **productivity**, and **subsidising** healthy pursuits may be one way of achieving this. There are arguments on both sides, however, which we will discuss here.

On the one hand, it might be said that if workers are fitter and less stressed, their working time will be more efficient, leading to higher levels of **output** and service. Furthermore, the **work/life balance** of the staff will hopefully be improved, because their leisure time will be more fulfilling. This may even be more **motivating** than **pay increments**, **perks**, or **financial rewards** such as **bonuses** or **incentives** which may be hard to attain. Finally, feeling healthier may lead to better **job satisfaction** which is in itself a motivating factor.

Conversely, the problem with such leisure-based subsidies is that their efficacy is virtuallyimpossible to quantify. For example, with **target-related** payments, employers can at least see whether the objectives are reached or not. It might also be said that, if this budget was spent on (for instance) **on the job training** or **day release programmes**, the employees would achieve better **career progression** and have better **job prospects**. These matters are all easier to **measure**, especially in **performance reviews** and **appraisals**, and may even help to reduce the risk of **redundancy** if the company **restructures**, **downsizes** or **outsources** its **workforce**.

Overall, it seems that, while health-related subsidies are **superficially** attractive, the lack of **measurability** is a substantial drawback. Spending funds on **ongoing training** would appear to be a better use of company or **Human Resources** budgets.

## Topic 2: Education and schooling

### Question - (OPINION > PERSON VIEW)

‘The Internet will never replace traditional course books in schools.’
How far do you agree with this prediction?

### Model Ans

There is a huge range of resources available to the modern teacher, and the right selection is crucial in delivering effective lessons. I agree that there will always be a place for course books in the school **curriculum**, despite the many benefits of the Internet.

Firstly, course books (whether conventional or digital) have been developed by **pedagogical** experts and designed to be incorporated into a subject **syllabus**, leading to testing procedures such as **formal examinations** or **continuous assessment**. This means that they are proven to improve students’ **academic achievement**, enhancing their potential for progression to further or higher education. Furthermore, the use of modern course books allows pupils to coordinate their studies as part of **group work**, hopefully making their lessons less **teacher-led** and more about **autonomous learning**. This in itself teaches **study skills** such as independent research and **synthesising sources**, rather than old-fashioned **rote-learning**. This is where the Internet, in fact, can play a useful part: to **supplement** and add to knowledge which the students are **assimilating** via their course books.

However, it is the role of teachers and school management generally to ensure that use of the Internet remains a **guided learning** process, and not an exercise in **data-gathering** from Internet sources which may be unreliable or even misleading.
It is true that the Internet can be invaluable for adults (for example in **distance learning** or **self-study** modules) who are able to **discriminate between sources** and **sift information** to **marshal their facts**. However, this is a mature skill and we should not assume that school age pupils are ready to do this.

Overall, it appears that course books, with their quality and depth of material, are set to remain an **integral part of the syllabus**. The internet can be judged a useful supplement to this, if used carefully and **under supervision**.

### Vocabulary

1. curriculum
2. **pedagogical** - experts in education and teaching
3. syllabus
4. **formal examinations**
5. **continuos assessment** (vs formal examinations)

## Topic 3: Children and families

### Question - (OPINION > DISCUSSION)

Some people believe that children should spend all of their free time with their families. Others believe that this is unnecessary or even negative. Discuss the possible arguments on both sides, and say which side you personally support.

### Model Ans

Nobody can deny that parental influence is important for children, at least in cases where children live with their parents, **foster parents** or **guardians**. However, it is by no means clear that children should spend time exclusively in the family, as we will see.

On the one hand, it may appear advisable for parents to act as **role models** and to establish **ground rules** for behaviour by spending as much time as possible with their children. This allows the youngsters to absorb **conventions** and **codes of conduct** which they can then follow themselves, hopefully leading to an absence of problems such as **bullying**, **truancy** and **delinquency** later on. Furthermore, being with the family should reduce the risk of children falling victim to crimes such **abduction**, or coming under the influence of negative **peer pressure**.

On the other hand, we have to ask whether this is a practical proposition. In a society where many families are **dual-income**, or where one parent’s role as **breadwinner** means he/she is away from the family for long periods, it is inevitable that children cannot spend all of their time with the family. **Child-minding** and **after-school childcare** are often used in these cases, and if managed properly, these can be perfectly **viable** alternatives. Equally, it seems that children can in some cases learn a considerable amount from their **peers** in addition to adults, and allowing them to play without direct supervision may be a benefit.

To conclude, it appears that, while family time is essential for **bonding** and absorbing **patterns of behaviour**, there are definite advantages when children are outside the family too. This is provided that they are in a safe, **well-behaved** environment with peers who are themselves reasonably **well brought-up**.

### Vocabulary

1. **foster parents** - temporary commitment (unlike adoption)
2. guardians
3. role models
4. ground rules - basic rules governing the way people can behave in a situation
5. conventions - traditions
6. codes of conduct - voluntary rules which people accept in a situation
7. bullying
8. **truancy** - when a pupil leaves school without permission (verb = to **play truant** from school)
9. **delinquency** - minor crime (often by young people)
10. abduction
11. peer pressure

16. viable - practical
17. peers - people in the same group or level as yourself
18. bonding
19. patterns of behaviour - ways of acting an doing things
20. well brought-up (to bring up children = to raise and educate them in your own moral, behavioural or religious conventions)

## Topic 4: Nature, the environment and energy

### Question - (IDEAS > CAUSE/EFFECT)

Pollution of rivers, lakes and seas is a major concern for people who seek to protect the environment. What are the possible causes of water pollution, and what effects does this have on animal life and human society?

### Model Ans

Water **contamination** is a serious form of pollution, and one that can be challenging to rectify. There seem to be two main causes involved, and a variety of damaging effects on people and the **biosphere**, which we will discuss here.

Probably the main factor is the issue of **emissions** from cars, factories and other human activities. These emissions contain damaging **pollutant particles** which can contaminate rainwater **run-off** and thus enter the **water cycle**, by transferring through the **water table** into **aquifers**, streams and rivers. **Filtration** and processing are not really viable options for such large volumes of water, and so the water table remains **tainted** with these elements over long periods, as we see in Eastern Europe today. In situations where **soil erosion** and **logging** have already damaged the local environment, the accumulation can be very serious. The other major cause is accidental or deliberate **dumping** of **waste** products in places outside of controlled **landfills** or **waste processing** centres. Even small amounts of abandoned waste can enter water supplies through the ground, often undetected.

The effects on animal life can be severe, especially for species which are already endangeredby such threats as **poaching**, **habitat loss** and **food chain disruption**. Contaminated water can lead to **dwindling numbers** or even potential **extinction**, as may indeed happen to the Asian tiger populations. The impact on human society can also be distressing, including the poisoning of drinking water, **famine** or **drought** due to lack of safe **irrigation**, and long-term loss of land as we see, for example, after the Bhopal poisoning **catastrophe** in India. Such effects tend to have an especially grave impact on the very poorest in society, with the least resources to counter the environmental effects.

Overall, we see that emissions and dumping are the main origins of the problem, and that the effects on both humans and animals are **exacerbated** by the existing environmental, criminal or social problems

### Vocabulary

## Topic 5: Culture, art and traditions

### Question (IDEAS > EVALUATE)

In many countries, traditional dress and costumes are considered effective ways of maintaining links with the past. How effective can traditional costumes be, in this sense?
What other ways exist to help citizens connect with a country’s past?

### Model Ans

Most people would agree that **preserving** connections with our past is an admirable objective, especially as the world evolves so rapidly. I feel that traditional costumes are one part of doing this, but they are by no means the most important, as we shall see.

Admittedly, historic dress plays a key role in social events such as religious **rituals** or military **parades**, and these events are helpful in **transmitting social memes** such as **public duty** and **self-sacrifice**. Traditional costumes also remind us of the origins of **cultural traditions and mythologies**, for instance the historic Swiss national dress which **evokes** their **medieval** independence.

However, it must be said that costumes are an accessory in these situations, and do not appear to constitute the central message. It is the **ceremonies** themselves which convey the **cultural norms** that help to maintain **the fabric of society**. In this sense, the costumes are of secondary importance. Furthermore, it seems that there are in fact much more powerful ways in which culture is conserved and **handed down** between the generations. Most countries have a rich **heritage** of **legends** and **folklore** about the birth and development of their nation, some of which are mythological and some being grounded in truth (as we see in the English stories about Robin Hood or George and the Dragon, for example.) These stories are a **cultural inheritance** which embodies important symbols and concepts far more effectively than dress. Similarly, we must remember the significance of art and music in passing on our traditions, in **forms** ranging from **fine art** to **handicrafts**, and from **opera** to traditional **shanties** and **dirges**. The presence of visual or **linguistic** messages in these **media** make them more effective than costumes, which convey no language.

Overall, we must recognise and welcome the use of traditional dress in helping to maintain our cultures. However, the forms of story, art and music would appear to be the driving forces in this invaluable process.

### Vocabulary

2. rituals
3. parades
4. **social memes** - social habit or patterns which are transmitted between people

## Topic 6: Healthcare, health and sport

### Question (IDEA > PROBLEM/SOLUTION)

Many doctors are concerned about the high use of computer games by children and young people. What mental and physical problems may arise from excessive use of these games? How could these problems be reduced?

### Model Ans

Children appear to enjoy playing video games, and while there are undoubted benefits, various negative effects **stem** from this too. Let us consider the main issues, and then outline possible remedies.

Perhaps the major physical problem is the **sedentary lifestyle** which these games encourage, meaning that youngsters may incline to **obesity** or **inadequate development**. Added to this is the **strain** on eyesight resulting from excessive use of screens and consoles, meaning that children may suffer **symptoms** of poor vision. There are also concerns about **impairment** of reflexes due to the repetitive nature of the hand muscles when playing these games, and about the **poor diet** of **convenience food** which often accompanies this lifestyle.

The most alarming psychological impact of such activities is possibly the risk of **addiction**, meaning that children become obsessed with the games and are unable to **socialise** with family or peers. This undermines their **interpersonal skills** and makes them **underperform** both academically and socially.

Turning to possible solutions, perhaps the immediate step would be to promote a more **active lifestyle** through exercise **regimes** or sports **programmes** which would help to **detoxify** the lifestyles of children affected. This could be done through **sponsorship** of sports, or **participation** in **competitive** events such as races or matches, hopefully **ameliorating the physical effects** of excessive games use. Potential **remedies** for the danger of mental addiction may be, firstly, an **initiative** to **raise awareness** of the risks of the situation, for example through **health warnings** on games packaging or through high-profile spokespersons spreading such a message. For example, if sports **champions** or **figureheads** speak out about these dangers, the message may well get through to children.

To sum up, the risks posed by excessive gaming are connected to an unhealthy lifestyle and the possibility of **dependency** on the activity. Possible answers might involve stronger education about the dangers and the health benefits of more active **pursuits**.

## Topic 7: global challenges

### Question (OPINION > PERSONAL VIEW)

‘Unemployment remains the biggest challenge to school-leavers in most countries’
How far do you agree with this assessment? What other challenges face young people today?

### Model Ans

Youth unemployment is certainly a worrying **challenge** for most countries, especially at a time of **economic instability** and **social unrest**. However, to say that this is the largest **issue** is to overlook a range of equally **pressing matters**, as we will discuss now.

It must be admitted that **joblessness** can undermine a young person’s **economic prospects** and consequent **social mobility**. Nevertheless, this issue can be ameliorated by coordinated action between the state and the **private sector**, as we have seen, for instance, in Canada recently. When this is realized, we can see that other concerns are at least as serious.

Foremost among these is perhaps the issue of age **demographics**, whereby young people bearthe burden for an increasingly elderly population with high **longevity**. This means that young people will pay higher taxes and work longer hours, possibly forcing them to **migrate** to countries where this pressure is lower. The effect of this is the **‘brain drain’** situation which can be seen in southern Europe, where young, ambitious people prefer to leave their countries altogether, exacerbating the problem for those remaining.

Furthermore, we must remember that a substantial proportion of young people globally face **existential threats** such as **famine**, **drought** or **outbreaks** of disease. These problems are often caused by (or are compounded by) **civil war**, **political instability** or the **corruption** of people in power locally. Such risks are a danger to their safety in addition to their livelihood, and so would appear to be far more serious than unemployment.

To conclude, it seems logical to accept that joblessness is a major challenge for young people. However, persistent trends in demographics among **developed countries** and the presence of physical dangers in **developing countries** should be regarded as at least as severe.

### Vocabulary

1. a challenge
2. economic or political instability
3. social unrest

## Topic 8: Cities and infrastucture

### Question (IDEAS > MIXED > CAUSE SOLUTION)

Transport delays and long journey times are a widespread phenomenon in many cities today. What are the causes of this problem, and how could the situation be improved?

### Model Ans

Transport is an essential part of **urban** life, and lengthy journeys are frustrating and expensive for those concerned. There appear to be two main causes of this, and several possible solutions, as we will explain here.

Perhaps the main cause is the lack of **investment or funding for infrastructure** in the form of **high-capacity public transport** and increased road space for private vehicles. This means that too many vehicles use the existing network, and **congestion** is inevitable. We see this in most large cities globally, such as London or Tokyo. Many **conurbations** also lack finance for **transport hubs**, such as integrated road and rail **facilities** which could connect public and private transport, thus reducing **bottlenecks**. A further cause seems to be the problem of **overcrowding** in cities, whereby people migrate from the **hinterland** and **settle** in urban areas, putting strain on **amenities**, housing and above all on transport capacity. This means that an already stretched system is often pushed to a critical point, causing cancellations and breakdowns in the technology used, especially in situations of **urban sprawl** such as in Latin America.

Regarding potential solutions, probably the main remedy would be to encourage investment inbetter infrastructure, for example through subsidies or **public-private partnerships** as was tried successfully in Germany during the 1990’s. This enhances the network and fosters a sense of **civic pride**, to everyone’s benefit. Another solution may be to use **tax incentives** to allow more home working, so that there is less need to **commute** from the **suburbs** to the **inner city** for work. A final response might be the development of more flexible patterns of transport, such as **communal car-pooling**, which would reduce reliance on existing systems and vehicles.

In conclusion, it seems that **outdated** infrastructure and overcrowding are the key factors behind our transport frustrations. Possible solutions would involve better funding, and also innovations in ways of working and travelling to reduce the burden on the system.
